## Introduction

This is a simple OneSignal wrapper library for Laravel. It simplifies the basic
notification flow with the defined methods. You can send a message to all users
or you can notify a single user. Before you start installing this service, 
please complete your OneSignal setup at https://onesignal.com and finish all 
the steps that is necessary to obtain an application id and REST API Keys.


## Installation

First, you'll need to require the package with Composer:

```sh
composer require berkayk/onesignal-laravel
```

Afterwards, run `composer update` from your command line.

**You only need to do the following if your Laravel version is below 5.5**:

Then, update `config/app.php` by adding an entry for the service provider.

```php
'providers' => [
	// ...
	Berkayk\OneSignal\OneSignalServiceProvider::class
];
```

Then, register class alias by adding an entry in aliases section

```php
'aliases' => [
	// ...
	'OneSignal' => Berkayk\OneSignal\OneSignalFacade::class
];
```


Finally, from the command line again, run 

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Berkayk\OneSignal\OneSignalServiceProvider" --tag="config"
``` 

to publish the default configuration file. 
This will publish a configuration file named `onesignal.php` which includes 
your OneSignal authorization keys.

> **Note:** If the previous command does not publish the config file successfully, 
> please check the steps involving *providers* and *aliases* in the `config/app.php` file.


## Configuration

You need to fill in your OneSignal *App ID* and *REST API Key* inside your
.env file like this:
```
ONESIGNAL_APP_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
ONESIGNAL_REST_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
You can control timeout of the Guzzle client used by OneSignalClient by adding following into your .env file
```
ONESIGNAL_GUZZLE_CLIENT_TIMEOUT=integer_value
```
This param is useful when you are planning to send push notification via [Laravel queues](https://divinglaravel.com/always-set-a-timeout-for-guzzle-requests-inside-a-queued-job) 

## Usage

### Sending a Notification To All Users

You can easily send a message to all registered users with the command

```php
    OneSignal::sendNotificationToAll(
        "Some Message", 
        $url = null, 
        $data = null, 
        $buttons = null, 
        $schedule = null,
        $headings = null,
        $subtitle = null,
        $ios_badgeType = null,
        $ios_badgeCount = null
    );
```
    
`$url` , `$data` , `$buttons`, `$schedule`, `$headings`, `$subtitle`, `$ios_badgeType`, and `$ios_badgeCount` fields are optional. If you 
provide a `$url` parameter, users will be redirected to that url. `$ios_badgeType` can be set to "None", "SetTo", or "Increase", determining how the badge number should be modified and `$ios_badgeCount` is the integer value to set the badge to, or the amount by which to increase or decrease it (you can use a negative integer to decrease), depending on the badge type set.
    

### Sending a Notification based on Tags/Filters

You can send a message based on a set of tags with the command

  ##### Example 1:

```php
    OneSignal::sendNotificationUsingTags(
        "Some Message",
        array(
            ["field" => "tag", "key" => "email", "relation" => "=", "value" => "email21@example.com"],
            ["field" => "tag", "key" => "email", "relation" => "=", "value" => "email1@example.com"],
            ...
        ),
        $url = null,
        $data = null,
        $buttons = null,
        $schedule = null
    );
```
    
  ##### Example 2:

```php
    OneSignal::sendNotificationUsingTags(
        "Some Message",
        array(
            ["field" => "tag", "key" => "session_count", "relation" => ">", "value" => '2'],
            ["field" => "tag", "key" => "first_session", "relation" => ">", "value" => '2000'],
        ),
        $url = null,
        $data = null,
        $buttons = null,
        $schedule = null
    );
```

### Sending a Notification To A Specific User

After storing a user's token in a table, you can simply send a message with

```php
    OneSignal::sendNotificationToUser(
        "Some Message",
        $userId,
        $url = null,
        $data = null,
        $buttons = null,
        $schedule = null,
        $headings = null,
        $subtitle = null,
        $ios_badgeType = null,
        $ios_badgeCount = null
    );
```
    
`$userId` is the user's unique id where he/she is registered for notifications. 
Read https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/add-user-data-tags for additional details.
`$url` , `$data` , `$buttons` and `$schedule` fields are optional. If you provide 
a `$url` parameter, users will be redirected to that url. `$ios_badgeType` can be set to "None", "SetTo", or "Increase", determining how the badge number should be modified and `$ios_badgeCount` is the integer value to set the badge to, or the amount by which to increase or decrease it (you can use a negative integer to decrease), depending on the badge type set.



### Sending a Notification To A Specific external User (custom user id added by user)

After storing a user's token in a table, you can simply send a message with

```php
    OneSignal::sendNotificationToExternalUser(
        "Some Message",
        $userId,
        $url = null,
        $data = null,
        $buttons = null,
        $schedule = null,
        $headings = null,
        $subtitle = null,
        $ios_badgeType = null,
        $ios_badgeCount = null
    );
```

`$userId` is the user's unique external id (custom id) added by the user where he/she is registered for notifications.
Read https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/add-user-data-tags for additional details.
`$url` , `$data` , `$buttons` and `$schedule` fields are exceptional. If you provide
a `$url` parameter, users will be redirected to that url.

### Sending a Notification To Segment

You can simply send a notification to a specific segment with

```php
    OneSignal::sendNotificationToSegment(
        "Some Message",
        $segment,
        $url = null,
        $data = null,
        $buttons = null,
        $schedule = null
    );
```
    
`$url` , `$data` , `$buttons` and `$schedule` fields are optional. If you 
provide a `$url` parameter, users will be redirected to that url. `$ios_badgeType` can be set to "None", "SetTo", or "Increase", determining how the badge number should be modified and `$ios_badgeCount` is the integer value to set the badge to, or the amount by which to increase or decrease it (you can use a negative integer to decrease), depending on the badge type set.

### Sending a Custom Notification

You can send a custom message with 

```php
    OneSignal::sendNotificationCustom($parameters);
```

    
### Sending a async Custom Notification
You can send a async custom message with 

```php
    OneSignal::async()->sendNotificationCustom($parameters);
```    
    
Please refer to https://documentation.onesignal.com/reference for all customizable parameters.

## Examples

Some people found examples confusing, so I am going to provide some detailed examples that I use in my applications. These examples will probably guide you on customizing your notifications. For custom parameters, please refer to https://documentation.onesignal.com/reference/create-notification.

### 1) Sending a message to a segment with custom icon and custom icon color

You need to customize `android_accent_color` and `small_icon` values before sending your notifications. These are `parameters` that you need to specify while sending your notifications.

```php
use OneSignal;

$params = [];
$params['android_accent_color'] = 'FFCCAA72'; // argb color value
$params['small_icon'] = 'ic_stat_distriqt_default'; // icon res name specified in your app

$message = "Test message to send";
$segment = "Testers";
OneSignal::addParams($params)->sendNotificationToSegment(
                $message,
                $segment
            );

// or to all users 
OneSignal::addParams($params)->sendNotificationToAll($message);

```

### 2. Sending a message with high priority

This time, we will specify parameters one after the other.

```php
use OneSignal;

$message = "Test message to send";
$segment = "Testers";
OneSignal::setParam('priority', 10)->sendNotificationToSegment(
                $message,
                $segment
            );

// You can chain as many parameters as you wish

OneSignal::setParam('priority', 10)->setParam('small_icon', 'ic_stat_onesignal_default')->setParam('led_color', 'FFAACCAA')->sendNotificationToAll($message);

```

### 3. Sending a message with custom heading and subtitle

```php
use OneSignal;

OneSignal::sendNotificationToSegment(
                "Test message with custom heading and subtitle",
                "Testers", 
                null, null, null, null, 
                "Custom Heading", 
                "Custom subtitle"
            );
```

### 4. Sending a delayed message to a specific user with many custom parameters

```php
use OneSignal;

$userId = "3232331-1722-4fee-943d-23123asda123"; 
$params = []; 
$params['include_player_ids'] = [$userId]; 
$contents = [ 
   "en" => "Some English Message", 
   "tr" => "Some Turkish Message"
]; 
$params['contents'] = $contents; 
$params['delayed_option'] = "timezone"; // Will deliver on user's timezone 
$params['delivery_time_of_day'] = "2:30PM"; // Delivery time

OneSignal::sendNotificationCustom($params);

```
